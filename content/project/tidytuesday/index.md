## A weekly visualization challenge

TidyTuesday is a project from the R4DS community. Every week they post a 'tamed' (but not always tidy) dataset for everyone to explore. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater RStats community. 

I love how diverse their datasets are. There are some about the environment (for example this year there has been one on global deforestation, plastic pollution and on droughts in the US), about gaming (SteamCharts and Mario Kart World Records), about movies (Netflix titles and one on the Bechdel test), coffee ratings, Ikea furniture and so much more! If you want to join, I am sure you will find something interesting to get going.
