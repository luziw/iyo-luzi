## Introducing myself online

I was looking for another project to do until I start my masters degree in October and I stumbled upon a workshop from RStudio called [Introduce yourself online](https://iyo-rstudio-global.netlify.app/). I already have a Wordpress blog where I write about vegetables and how Ottolenghi teaches me how to cook and I have been curious about blogdown, Hugo and Netlify for a while now so I figured I'd give it a go. 
As resources, I mainly used Alison Hill's [workshop for Rladies Tunis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RksaNh5Ywbo), her [blog](https://alison.rbind.io/blog/) and [RStudio's collection of materials](https://iyo-rstudio-global.netlify.app/collection/) so far. I am still pretty new to all of this so everything you see here is definitely a work in progress!
