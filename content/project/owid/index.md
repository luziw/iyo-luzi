## [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) publishes (interactive) data visualizations about the world's biggest problems

### What I am doing

I try to recreate plots from Our World in Data using R. I was looking online for inspiration and data that does not need too much cleaning and I rediscovered OWID. They publish (interactive) data visualizations about everything from agriculture to working hours. Their material is completely open access under the Creative Commons BY license and the data is downloadable from their website or from [github](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets). 

The challenge is to make plots as close to the original as possible while making room for the possibility of small improvements. For now, I focus on making simple plots but recreating some interactive ones might be interesting in the future.
