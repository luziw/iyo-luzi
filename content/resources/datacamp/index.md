If you are a student, you can get three months for free via the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). This is what I am currently using. I am not sure if I will pay for DataCamp, once this subscription is over but I think this is a great opportunity for exploring their courses and seeing if their courses work for you.
