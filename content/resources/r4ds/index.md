R for Data Science is a textbook that can be accessed for free [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) or you can buy a physical copy. 

I worked with this book during the second Covid lockdown in Vienna and I loved it. It starts with data visualization, which is great because this way, you soon have something to show for and literally seeing my progress was very motivating. It then goes on to data wrangling, programming and modeling and closes with some remarks on data communication and an introduction to R Markdown. I have learned a lot from this book and frequently come back to it.
